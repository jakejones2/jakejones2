- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a freelance web developer and recent graduate of the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) bootcamp.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm currently working with Typescript, Python and C#, mainly building with Next.js and headless CMSs. Check out some of my projects, such as my online game [*Mates Rate*](https://github.com/jakejones2/mates-rate).
- ðŸŒ± Among other things I'm looking to improve my knowledge of ML - attempting reinforcement learning at the moment with PettingZoo and RLlib so any tips much appreciated!
