- 👋 Hi! I’m a software developer usually working on web applications. Python and .NET by trade but most my personal projects live in the Javascript/React ecosystem.
- 🏗️ Like many people here I have lots of unfinished projects I'd like more time for... Hoping I can resume training my RL agents to play Coup (the card game) some time soon, and my Subbuteo management and analytics [app](https://subbuteo-league.vercel.app/) is still largely pending. There are a few older projects on my [github.io](https://jakejones2.github.io/) you can have a look at though!
<!---
jakejones2/jakejones2 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
